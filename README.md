ðŸ¦¾ I'm Kobe, a data engineer who loves computers and programming. I am always excited to analyse issues and dive into technical rabbit holes. 

I design and implement data solutions that directly benefit the business. As a cloud architect, I am proficient in developing cloud-based solutions that are both scalable and secure.

I'm also passionate about AI and micro-robotics. I always look for ways to incorporate these technologies into my day-to-day & projects to drive innovation and efficiency.

If there is one thing I enjoy more than computers, it is working with people. I like to work in different teams or fields. I also enjoy organising knowledge-sharing sessions & coaching colleagues.

When I am not working, I like to spend my time on passive investing, reading sci-fi books and volunteer work.
