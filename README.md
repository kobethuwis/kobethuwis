ðŸ¦¾ Driven data engineer & robotics enthusiast

Programming and working with computers in general has been a passion for quite some time. Huge fan of application-oriented development, resolving case-specific issues and deep dives into technical rabbit holes. 

Like to devote my time as well to passive investing, reading sci-fi books, volunteer work, financial planning, watching mystery movies & (cyber)security.
