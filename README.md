ðŸ¦¾ Driven data engineer & robotics enthusiast

Programming and working with computers in general has been a passion for quite some time. 

Switching views, working on agile projects and deep dives into technical rabbit holes often motivate me to study new topics, tackle hard challenges and deliver results.

I like to devote my time as well to passive investing, sci-fi books, volunteer work, cinema & movies, financial planning & (cyber)-security.
